  Zoom Whiteboard MCP server guidance. Use for Whiteboard MCP auth, endpoints, ID mapping,
  and tool workflows such as list_whiteboards and get_a_whiteboard. Prefer this child

# Zoom MCP Whiteboard

Dedicated guidance for Zoom's Whiteboard MCP server.

## Endpoints

| Transport | URL |
|-----------|-----|
| Streamable HTTP (recommended) | `https://mcp-us.zoom.us/mcp/whiteboard/streamable` |
| SSE (fallback) | `https://mcp-us.zoom.us/mcp/whiteboard/sse` |

## Authentication

- **User OAuth with Whiteboard scopes** is the verified working path for `list_whiteboards`
  and `get_a_whiteboard`.
- **S2S OAuth** can reach the Whiteboard MCP gateway and complete `tools/list`, but tool
  execution must be validated separately for your app and Whiteboard scopes.
- Practical rule: start with **user OAuth** for Whiteboard MCP unless you have already
  proven your S2S app can mint and execute with the required Whiteboard scopes.

Reference: [references/authentication-and-identifiers.md](references/authentication-and-identifiers.md)

## Required Scopes

Whiteboard MCP read scopes:
- `whiteboard:read:list_whiteboards`
- `whiteboard:read:whiteboard`

Write-capable Whiteboard metadata advertised by the gateway:
- `whiteboard:write:whiteboard`

## Whiteboard ID Mapping

For Whiteboard MCP, use the identifier from the URL segment after `/wb/db/`, not the numeric
segment after `/p/`.

Example:

```text
https://us05whiteboard.zoom.us/wb/db/6iktP8hJT3e5qaCuwFuAGg/p/180968285929472
                                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                                     whiteboard_id            page/subresource id
```

## Available Tools

The current Whiteboard MCP tool surface is:

- `create_a_whiteboard_for_brainstorming`
- `list_whiteboards`
- `create_a_whiteboard`
- `get_a_whiteboard`
- `create_a_whiteboard_by_script`
- `update_a_whiteboard_metadata`
- `create_a_whiteboard_for_meeting_summary`
- `create_a_whiteboard_for_strategy_analysis`

Some MCP clients namespace server tools in the UI. Treat the raw tool names above as
authoritative.

## Read Workflow

1. Use a user OAuth token with the Whiteboard read scopes.
2. Call `list_whiteboards` to discover accessible whiteboards and confirm the correct `whiteboard_id`.
3. Call `get_a_whiteboard` with that `whiteboard_id`.
