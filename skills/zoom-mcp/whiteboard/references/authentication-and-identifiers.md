# Authentication and Identifiers — Whiteboard MCP

Guidance for `https://mcp.zoom.us/mcp/whiteboard/streamable` and
`https://mcp.zoom.us/mcp/whiteboard/sse`.

## Authentication Behavior

Use user-level OAuth for Whiteboard MCP and request the scopes required by the specific tools you need.

Tool-to-scope mapping:
- `add_a_whiteboard_collaborator` → `whiteboard:write:collaborator:admin`
- `create_a_whiteboard` → `whiteboard:write:whiteboard`
- `create_a_whiteboard_by_script` → `whiteboard:write:whiteboard`
- `create_a_whiteboard_for_brainstorming` → `whiteboard:write:whiteboard`
- `create_a_whiteboard_for_meeting_summary` → `whiteboard:write:whiteboard`
- `create_a_whiteboard_for_strategy_analysis` → `whiteboard:write:whiteboard`
- `delete_a_whiteboard_collaborator` → `whiteboard:delete:collaborator:admin`
- `get_a_whiteboard` → `whiteboard:read:whiteboard:admin`
- `get_a_whiteboard_collaborator` → `whiteboard:read:list_collaborators:admin`
- `list_whiteboards` → `whiteboard:read:list_whiteboards:admin`
- `update_a_whiteboard_collaborator` → `whiteboard:update:collaborator:admin`

## Whiteboard ID Mapping

The MCP-facing `whiteboard_id` matches the URL segment after `/wb/db/`.

Example:

```text
https://us05whiteboard.zoom.us/wb/db/6iktP8hJT3e5qaCuwFuAGg/p/180968285929472
```

- Correct MCP `whiteboard_id`: `6iktP8hJT3e5qaCuwFuAGg`
- The numeric `/p/...` segment is not the Whiteboard MCP identifier.

## Response Shape

`get_a_whiteboard` returned a list-style payload containing the matched whiteboard rather than
an obviously single-object payload. Parse the response shape you actually receive from the live
server instead of assuming the tool name implies a unique-object response.
