# Zoom MCP

Background reference for Claude-accessible Zoom MCP workflows. Prefer `design-mcp-workflow` or [mcp-setup](../mcp-setup/SKILL.md) first, then route here for tool-surface details and MCP-specific constraints.

# Zoom MCP Server

Zoom hosts an MCP server at `mcp-us.zoom.us` for AI-agent access to:

- semantic meeting search
- meeting-linked asset retrieval
- recording resource retrieval
- Zoom Docs creation from Markdown

Current tool names from the Zoom MCP server:

- `create_new_file_with_markdown`
- `get_meeting_assets`
- `search_meetings`
- `get_recording_resource`
- `recordings_list`

Some MCP clients namespace server tools in the UI, for example `zoom-mcp:recordings_list`.
Treat the raw tool names above as authoritative.

Whiteboard-specific MCP work is covered by the dedicated skill
[whiteboard/SKILL.md](whiteboard/SKILL.md).

## Quick Start

**1. Add to an MCP client (Claude Code example):**
```bash
claude mcp add --transport http zoom-mcp \
  https://mcp-us.zoom.us/mcp/zoom/streamable \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ZOOM_OAUTH_TOKEN" \
  --scope user
```

**2. Verify discovery:**
- Confirm the client can see `recordings_list`, `search_meetings`, `get_meeting_assets`,
  `get_recording_resource`, and `create_new_file_with_markdown`.
- If the client exposes raw protocol inspection, `tools/list` is the authoritative discovery source.
- The current catalog is documented in [references/tools.md](references/tools.md).

**3. Run the first useful call:**
```text
recordings_list
  userId: "me"
  from: "2026-03-01"
  to: "2026-03-06"
  page_size: 10
```

## Critical Notes

**1. User OAuth is the recommended execution path**

A Server-to-Server OAuth token can:
- initialize against the MCP gateway
- complete `tools/list`
- open SSE sessions

Use user OAuth as the default execution path for Zoom MCP tool use unless you have already
validated S2S scope coverage and tool execution for your app.

**2. Zoom MCP uses MCP-specific granular scopes**

The Zoom MCP scope set is not the same as the older broad REST scopes.
The key scopes for this surface are:
- `meeting:read:search`
- `meeting:read:assets`
- `cloud_recording:read:list_user_recordings`
- `cloud_recording:read:content`
- `docs:write:import` for Zoom Docs creation

**3. AI Companion features are feature prerequisites, not scope substitutes**

Semantic meeting search, meeting assets, and recording-content retrieval depend on account
features such as **Smart Recording** and **Meeting Summary** for useful results. These feature
settings do not replace the required OAuth scopes.

**4. Whiteboard is a separate MCP surface**

The Zoom MCP endpoint and the Whiteboard MCP endpoint are separate. Route Whiteboard-specific
requests to [whiteboard/SKILL.md](whiteboard/SKILL.md).

**5. Use REST for deterministic meeting CRUD**

The current Zoom MCP tool surface does not expose deterministic
meeting create, update, or delete tools. If the user needs explicit meeting CRUD operations,
route to [../rest-api/SKILL.md](../rest-api/SKILL.md).

## Server Endpoints

| Transport | URL |
|-----------|-----|
| Streamable HTTP (recommended) | `https://mcp-us.zoom.us/mcp/zoom/streamable` |
| SSE (fallback) | `https://mcp-us.zoom.us/mcp/zoom/sse` |

Dedicated Whiteboard MCP skill:
- [whiteboard/SKILL.md](whiteboard/SKILL.md)

## Search and Retrieval Model

`search_meetings` uses AI Companion retrieval rather than a plain metadata filter. In this
use the live MCP server as authoritative for response schema and scope behavior.

Two result families matter most:

- **Recap-oriented results**: AI summary, meeting-linked documents, recordings, and related assets
- **Recording-oriented results**: cloud recording references and transcript-capable resources

Use [examples/transcript-retrieval.md](examples/transcript-retrieval.md) for the main retrieval
workflow.

## Tool Catalog

| Tool | Key Parameters | Required Scope |
|------|---------------|----------------|
| `create_new_file_with_markdown` | `content`*, `file_name`, `parent_id` | `docs:write:import` |
| `get_meeting_assets` | `meetingId`* | `meeting:read:assets` |
| `search_meetings` | `q`, `from`, `to`, `page_size`, `next_page_token` | `meeting:read:search` |
| `get_recording_resource` | `meetingId`*, `types`, `clip_num`, `play_time`, `raw_passcode`, `encode_passcode` | `cloud_recording:read:content` |
| `recordings_list` | `userId`*, `from`, `to`, `meeting_id`, `trash`, `trash_type`, `page_size`, `next_page_token` | `cloud_recording:read:list_user_recordings` |

\* Required parameter

## Key Workflows

**Search meeting content, then retrieve assets:**
```text
search_meetings
  q: "Q4 planning discussion"
  from: "2026-03-01"
  to: "2026-03-06"
→ choose a returned meeting
→ get_meeting_assets  meetingId: "MEETING_ID_OR_UUID"
```

**List recordings, then retrieve recording resources:**
```text
recordings_list
  userId: "me"
  from: "2026-03-01"
  to: "2026-03-06"
→ choose a recording target
→ get_recording_resource  meetingId: "MEETING_UUID_OR_RECORDING_ID"
```

**Create a Zoom Doc from Markdown:**
```text
create_new_file_with_markdown
  file_name: "Q4 Planning Notes"
  content: "# Decisions\n\n- ..."
```

## Error Reference

| Code | Meaning | Fix |
|------|---------|-----|
| `401 Unauthorized` | Missing or rejected bearer token at the endpoint | Re-register the MCP server with a valid bearer token |
| `-32001 Invalid access token` | Token expired, malformed, or missing required scopes | Refresh OAuth token and verify the MCP-specific scopes |
| `-32602 Can not found tool` | Requested tool name is not exposed by the active MCP server | Re-run `tools/list` and use the current tool names for that endpoint |
| `404` | Possible downstream resource-not-found response | Re-discover the target with `search_meetings` or `recordings_list` |
